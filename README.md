# reimbursementAPI
Project 1, The Tuition Reimbursement System, TRMS, allows users to submit reimbursements for courses and training. The submitted reimbursement must be approved by that employee's supervisor, department head, and benefits coordinator. The benefits coordinator then reviews the requests received before finalizing the reimbursement.
